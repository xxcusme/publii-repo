These trips offer a chance to explore different landscapes, beaches, and local culture within a day.</p><h3>Visit Nusa Penida</h3><p>Nusa Penida is a quiet island just off Bali’s southeast coast.

Plan your trip early as boats can fill up fast, especially during peak seasons.</p><h3>Explore Gili Islands</h3><p>The Gili Islands are three small islands near Lombok, accessible by a longer boat ride from Bali’s west coast. You can choose Gili Trawangan, Gili Air, or Gili Meno, each offering calm waters and coral reefs.</p><p>These islands have no cars, so you explore by bike or on foot. You’ll find white sandy beaches and good spots for diving and snorkeling. Sea turtles are common in the clear, shallow water.</p><p>Gili Trawangan is the most lively, with more restaurants and nightlife. Gili Air and Meno are quieter, good if you want a peaceful escape.
